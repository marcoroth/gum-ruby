Ruby wrapper for [Charm's Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum). A tool for glamorous scripts. This gem bundles the `gum` binary and provides an idiomatic Ruby API for all gum commands.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's `Gemfile` by executing:

```bash
bundle add gum-ruby
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install gum-ruby
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
